# Lab 01 - Hello MiraCostan!

_Learning Objective: Demonstrate editing and running Python code._

Welcome to your first lab!

## Instructions

_**First start by running the given code**_, this is the most basic version of any running Python program.

Next, check out the [MiraCosta website](https://www.miracosta.edu/current-students/index.html) to learn about support and resources available to students at MiraCosta College. Select one of the services you found interesting and use it to complete this lab.

_**To complete this lab**_, add code so it says:

```
Hello MiraCostan!
Did you know MiraCosta has services to help students succeed? Here is information about one of them.
```

Then add additional statements to print the name, contact info (location, phone, website, and/or email), and short description of the support service you chose.

For example, if I chose the food pantry then my output would be

```
Hello MiraCostan!

Name of service: Food pantry
Contact info: OC 3306, (760)757-2121 x2200, https://www.miracosta.edu/student-services/care/food-pantry.html
